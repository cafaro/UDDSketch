# UDDSketch -  Uniform DDSketch

A C implementation of the DDSketch algorithm [\[1\]][1] for quantile estimation with the following additions:

- uniform collapsing strategy, as described in [\[2\]][2];
- additional sketch implementation for dealing with negative values.

The code is inspired by the Java implementation of DDSketch [\[3\]][4] from [Datadog, Inc.][3]  and make use of the `libdict` C library from Farooq Mela [\[4\]][5].

# Build
Tested on Linux, but it should work on MacOS and other UNIX-like OSes.

You need CMake 3.15 or higher and build tools installed. 

Run the script `build.sh`. If everything goes fine, a sub-directory named 'install' will be created with all of the binaries.
